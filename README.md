<h4 align=center>Lightweight battery alarm application that aims to be cross-platform</h4>

## Features:
1) As lightweight as is possible by me (400kb)
2) As annoying as is possible (annoying-ness can be changed by using `config.json`)
3) That's it. This software is meant for 1 job and 1 job only

## TODO:
- [ ] Cross Platform support
- [ ] Source code improvement
- [ ] Dude the readme is pretty much vacant lmfao

##### Currently tested on Windows 10 only (*Nix support soon:tm:)
