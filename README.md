<h4 align=center>Lightweight battery alarm application that aims to be cross-platform</h4>

## Features:
1) As lightweight as possible (400kb)
2) As annoying as possible (annoying-ness can be changed by using `remindEvery` in `config.json`)
3) Hopefully cross-platform in the future
4) That's it. This software is meant for 1 job and 1 job only

## Config.json explanation
